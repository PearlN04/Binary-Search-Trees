TikTok Replica (Proof-of-Concept)
This project is a simple replica of some core features of the TikTok social media platform. It implements account management and post handling using a Binary Search Tree (BST). Users can create and delete accounts, add and display posts, and load actions from a file. The application allows interaction through a text-based menu for account and post management.
